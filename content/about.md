This site is a [GitHub](https://github.com/lorarjohns/plotly-crue/) repository of resources, blog posts, and tutorials for self-study and professional development in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Natural Language Processing.

It's difficult enough to keep up with the state of the art for seasoned professionals, let alone for those engaged in self-study or who find themselves feeling like their bootcamp education left important topics unexplored. Examples of what we will cover include:

* The pragmatic workflow of a data science project
* Working in a team with git and Github
* The essential math and algorithms you should study
* Virtual environments, Docker, Kubernetes, and why they're important
* Bash, Unix, and getting comfortable with the command line

Fairly or not, both depth and breadth are expected in the job search, so we'll tag things appropriately and provide roadmaps as best we can for you to choose your own adventure. We'll also strive to provide pragmatic advice on career changing, carving out a niche that works for you, and taking care of your well-being in the meantime.

The field of natural language processing is accelerating rapidly, and this site's creator works in that field, so expect plenty of content in that direction. Much of the techniques and architectures apply to other types of unstructured data; to image processing and computer vision; and to entire paradigms, such as auto-ML and reinforcement learning.

Feel free to contribute or leave comments or suggestions as issues on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/lorarjohns/plotly-crue/issues).
